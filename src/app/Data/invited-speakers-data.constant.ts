        speaker_name: 'Prof. Dr. Shaquat wasi (Pakistan)',
        speaker_bio: 'He is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University within the Distributed and Embedded Systems Unit and director of the ICT-competence center CISS, Center for Embedded Software Systems. In 2015 he won an ERC Advanced Grant with the project LASSO for learning, analysis, synthesis and optimization of cyber physical systems. He is also director of the Sino-Danish Basic Research Center IDEA4CPS, the Danish Innovation Network InfinIT, as well as the newly founded innovation research center DiCyPS: Data Intensive Cyber Physical Systems.'

        speaker_name: 'Prof. Dr. Raazi (Pakistan)',
        speaker_bio: 'He is an Associate Professor of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna (Italy). His research interests concerns agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) as a paradigm for modeling and engineering software systems. His main research contributions are in the context of Agent/MAS programming and Engineering MAS. Recent research investigations are about Mirror Worlds and Augmented Worlds, i.e. smart environments integrating multi-agent systems with “augmentation technologies” (Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality, Pervasive computing), and to the integration of (Machine) Learning into the process of Agent/MAS design and development.'

        speaker_bio: 'He studied electrical engineering with a focus on control engineering and computer science at the University of Karlsruhe and earned his doctorate in 1983 on the topic "New methods for order reduction and controller design based on reduced models". His research and work areas include u. a. the development of new methods and devices in the field of sensors, mechatronics and robotics in the industrial and medical sector, the navigation of mobile robots with the help of the PMD camera, outdoor robotics, tele-control, tele-manipulation, tele-presence and e-learning and Environmental Exploration.'

        speaker_name: 'Prof. Dr. Yasin khan (Pakistan)',
        speaker_bio: 'His current research interest is focussed on the development of new mathematical methods for the analysis of embedded systems behaviour. Important concepts that play a role in this are: - Axiomatic reasoning about execution intervals (and their prefix order); - Event-based modeling and simulation (Matlab SimEvents); - Dataflow graphs and max-plus algebra'
